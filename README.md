# Submarine Cable Map

This application was designed and developed by Esri's Applications Prototype Lab in Redlands, California using Esri's ArcGIS API for JavaScript (beta).

This application maps the global network of submarine communication cables. This app was inspired by TeleGeography's awesome Submarine Cable Map.

Data for this application was prepared by TeleGeography and published here. This data represents a cartographic representation of the actual data. For more information on, and access to, the authoritative data please visit the Global Bandwidth Research Service.

Data was downloaded from here and here as KML documents. The data is current as of November 2015.
